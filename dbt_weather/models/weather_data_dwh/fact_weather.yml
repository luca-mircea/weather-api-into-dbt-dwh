    description: >
      Fact table containing weather measurements over time, linked by timestamp, location, and measurement type.
      The unique identifier is a hash of timestamp, location_id, and measurement_id. Partitioned by date for performance,
      and clustered by measurement_id.

    config:
      materialized: table
      unique_key: fact_id

    columns:
      - name: fact_id
        description: >
          A unique identifier for each fact record, built as an MD5 hash of timestamp + location_id + measurement_id.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: fact_timestamp
        description: "The original timestamp of the measurement."

      - name: date_string
        description: >
          The date part of the timestamp, stored as a string (e.g., '2025-07-21'), used for partitioning the table.

      - name: location_id
        description: >
          Foreign key referencing the location_dimensions table. Computed as MD5 hash of latitude:longitude.

      - name: measurement_id
        description: >
          Foreign key referencing the measurement_dimensions table. Maps to a specific type of weather measurement.

      - name: measurement_value
        description: >
          The actual observed value for the measurement at the given timestamp and location.
